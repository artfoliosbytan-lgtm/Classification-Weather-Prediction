# Weather Classification Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting the type of weather using supervised machine learning classification algorithms.  
The model is trained on historical weather data and classifies weather conditions such as Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy, etc.

---

## Objective

The objective of this project is to build a multi-class classification model that accurately predicts the **Weather Type** based on input features from the dataset.

## Models Implemented

### 1. Random Forest Classifier
An ensemble learning algorithm that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve prediction accuracy.

### 2. XGBoost Classifier
A gradient boosting algorithm that builds trees sequentially, where each new tree corrects the errors of the previous one.
